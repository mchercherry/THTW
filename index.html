        <p>
          In 2002, the Boston Globe revealed the massive scale of sexual abuse on children in the Boston diocese and efforts by the Catholic hierarchy to cover it up. The paper’s investigation was the subject of the Oscar-winning film Spotlight.
          <br>In 2004, a church commission published a report requiring clergy to report suspicions of sexual assault.

        <h2>Approaching your child with care</h2>
        <p>
          If you suspect that your child or young adult may know something about the sex abuse scandal and be concerned about it, you can approach it by asking an open question like, &quot;So have you heard much about the sexual abuse scandal in the church?&quot; then proceed to &quot;What have you heard?&quot;
          <br>Although the sex abuse scandals in the church raise powerful emotions among Catholic adults, too much emotion can frighten children and make young adults uncomfortable.

        <p>
          Church leaders hold power. But, great power includes great responsibility. If someone misuses their power, the result is defined as &quot;abuse,&quot; which means to act in a manner to cause &quot;bad effect or for a bad purpose.&quot;
          <br>A church has power to gather, encourage, and heal God’s beloved people. If you’ve experienced church hurt, it can cause you to feel helpless and alone.

        <p>
          If you are a survivor of abuse who has been spiritually hurt and is reluctant, even afraid to return to church, you are not alone. According to dozens of studies involving more than 19,000 abused children, a large number of maltreated children have not only been injured physically and emotionally, but also spiritually.
          <br>A child may have prayed that the abuse stop and wonders why a God who can part seas and raise the dead chooses not to stop beatings, rapes, starvation and other atrocities.
